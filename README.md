This repository gives you a webpage with my profile information, including a photo, resume, project repositories, certificates, blog and email form.
Created using `ReactJS` , `create-react-app` and deployed in github pages. The great thing using `ReactJS` is that I can use react router to build single page applications to prevent a page refresh everytime link clicked.
